# Cooperation-In-ScaleFree-Network

This project provides a simple simulation program in C++ language which repeats the simulation research in the article [Scale-Free Networks Provide a Unifying Framework for the Emergence of Cooperation](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.098104)(F. C. Santos and J. M. Pacheco,2005,PRL).
It should be pointed out that the program uses OpenMP to achieve parallel operation, and the multi-core operation efficiency is high.
This project serves as a possible version of homework of the course Group Intelligence in Peking University(2025 spring).

The folder "src" stores cpp source file,and folder "include" stores all head files to be used.The MakeFile and CMakeLists.txt also are provided,so you can run it in different platforms,include Linux(recommended) and Windows.The results of the compilation exists in the build folder.

To visualize the data we get, I also provide the python script to show the graph and it's stored in the folder "scripts".

.All people are allowed to use and share this project.Thanks for watching.
